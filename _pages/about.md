I am a Lecturer (= Tenured Assistant Professor) in Child Language Acquisition in the <a href='https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/'>School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics</a> at Newcastle University in the UK. I am currently investigating the quantity and quality of input that is developmentally meaningful for children learning the same language.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Language Science at the University of California, Irvine, working with Lisa Pearl and funded by an SPRF grant from the National Science Foundation.

I recently received my Ph.D. in August 2021 from the University of Connecticut. My dissertation is titled <a href='/https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/006259'>The predictive power of lexical semantics on the acquisition of passive voice in young children</a> under the supervision of William Snyder, Lisa Pearl, Diane Lillo-Martin, and Letitia Naigles.
